# Hibernate_Curd_Operations

#Hibernate provides a framework for performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on database entities in a simple and efficient manner

Hibernate provides a framework for performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

* src/com/entity/Student.java:

This is likely the entity class representing a Student. It should be annotated with Hibernate/JPA annotations (like @Entity, @Table, @Id, etc.) to map the class to a database table.

* CRUD Operation Files (DeleteData.java, FetchData.java, GetSingleData.java, InsertData.java, UpdateData.java):

These files should contain methods for each CRUD operation:

InsertData.java: A method to insert new records into the database.

FetchData.java: A method to retrieve a list of records from the database.

GetSingleData.java: A method to fetch a single record based on an ID or other unique identifier.

UpdateData.java: A method to update existing records.

DeleteData.java: A method to delete records from the database.

3. hibernate.cfg.xml:

The Hibernate configuration file, where you specify the database connection details, dialect, and entity classes.

4. .classpath and project:

These files are usually related to IDE-specific configurations. .classpath is for Eclipse to manage dependencies.
